# 📊 Social Media Usage vs Productivity Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **social media usage** and **productivity levels** using a dataset of daily activity logs.  
The goal is to discover patterns, correlations, and potential impacts of excessive social media usage on personal or professional productivity.  
The analysis and visualization are performed using **Python in Google Colab**.

## 📂 Raw Dataset
You can access the raw dataset here:  
[👉 Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdimashayekhi/social-media-vs-productivity)

- Format: CSV  
- Number of records: 30000 
- Features: Age, gender, job type, daily social media time, social platform preference, number of notifications, work hours per day, perceived productivity score, actual productivity score, stress level, sleep hours, screen time before sleep, breaks during work, uses focus apps, has digital wellbeing enabled, coffee consumption per day, days feeling burnout per month, weekly offline hours, job satisfaction score

## 🔍 Insights & Findings
Key highlights from the analysis:
- The most popular social media platform preference is TikTok
- There is a very weak negative relationship between daily social media usage time and actual productivity, as indicated by a correlation coefficient of approximately -0.0109. This suggests that as daily social media time increases, actual productivity tends to decrease slightly, but the relationship is not strong, and other factors likely play a more significant role in productivity.
- The average daily social media time is approximately 3.11 hours
- There is essentially no linear relationship between the duration of social media use and stress level in this dataset, as indicated by a near-zero correlation coefficient (0.000772)
- Recomendation: To sustain productivity above 5, limit daily social media use to less than 3.09 hours, schedule engagement times, choose platforms wisely, consume content mindfully, and increase weekly offline time.


## 🤖 AI Support Explanation
AI tools were used to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, normalization).  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization libraries.  
- Identify correlations and trends using statistical and ML techniques.  
- Generate insights and automate reporting.  

The AI support ensures the analysis is **faster, more accurate, and scalable** for larger datasets.
